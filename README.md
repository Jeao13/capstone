# WEB-BASED DISCIPLINE GRIEVANCE SYSTEM

In response to the growing challenges posed by an expanding student population and diverse backgrounds, our project addresses the critical need for streamlined grievance management within academic institutions. The development of a web-based discipline grievance system stands as our proactive solution, emphasizing accessibility and user-friendliness. Leveraging Flask, Python, Agile methodology, and a Linear SVC algorithm for offense prediction, the system aims to create a positive, safe, and inclusive environment for all stakeholders. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 16, our project contributes to the establishment of peaceful societies and robust, inclusive institutions. Adopting an agile approach and utilizing Python and Flask for system development, along with the incorporation of a Linear SVC algorithm for offense prediction, our methodology emphasizes adaptability and effectiveness. The findings showcase the system's efficacy in providing users with a straightforward platform to file complaints, submit ISO forms to department administrators, and effortlessly track the status of their concerns. The predictive analytics feature demonstrates high accuracy in identifying potential offenses from the Student Handbook, showcasing its capability to handle complaints written in gibberish. With a deliberate focus on a user-friendly design, our project places a premium on transparency and user engagement, thereby enhancing institutional accountability and improving grievance resolution efficiency. Through the establishment of this platform, our research highlights the significance of accessible, transparent, and user-friendly systems in fostering positive institutional environments.
